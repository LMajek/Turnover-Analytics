# Turnover-Analytics

A MySQL and Power BI project analysing turnover trends.

## Project Overview

A client is concerned about their employee turnover rates. They want to know what retention looks like across the business and find out if there are any factors that make an employee more likely to leave the company.

## Objective

Using SQL for data extraction and Power BI for visualisation, I will discern patterns and identify potential variables that might influence an employee's decision to exit the company.

## Results and Insights

Analysis indicates an upward trend in turnover rates during the period of 2020-2022. The data also reveals that the most pronounced attrition is among employees based in Pennsylvania, within the age bracket of 18-24, and those affiliated with the Accounting and Auditing departments. A detailed breakdown is as follows: 


### 1) Pennsylvania: 

The heatmap indicates a disproportionate attrition rate in the Pennsylvania office relative to its staff count. This trend might signify regional challenges, potentially stemming from economic fluctuations or regulatory constraints. Alternatively, the elevated attrition could be indicative of internal organisational challenges unique to this location. 

Recommendations: 

* Undertake a detailed local market analysis to gauge competitive compensation structures and benefit packages. 

* Consider region-specific benefits, such as transportation allowances, to alleviate potential external pressures. 

* Implement active engagement strategies for employees stationed in this office. 

* Establish robust feedback mechanisms to assess employee satisfaction and address concerns. 
 

### 2) Age Group 18-24: 

Because of their young age, employees within the 18-24 age bracket are likely to be early on in their career journeys and have spent fewer years working at the company. Younger employees might be seeking more diverse experiences and are thus less committed to long-term positions.   

Recommendations: 

* Encourage employee loyalty through tenure-based rewards or benefits that become available after specific milestones. 

* If there's an established recruitment mechanism for young employees, like a graduate program, it warrants a review. High attrition might indicate challenges in the onboarding process or misalignment between role expectations and realities. 

* Introduce mentorship or peer-assistance initiatives to ensure continuous guidance and support. 

* Propose rotational assignments enabling employees to explore varied roles or departments, enriching their professional exposure. 

* Enhance avenues for skill development and training, tailored to address the nuances of early career stages. 

 
### 3) Accounting and Auditing Departments: 

The turnover rates in the Accounting and Auditing surpass the organisational average. These departments often face high-stress periods, such as year-end closing or tax season, which can lead to burnout. Notably within these departments, age groups 25-34 and 18-24 have the highest attrition. It is worth noting that this is the age bracket that many professionals in these fields attain their full accounting qualifications.  

Recommendations: 

* Introduce competitive compensation and bonus structures, especially for fully qualified staff. 

* Chart out distinct career progression pathways, ensuring they are transparently communicated and accessible. 

* Consider the inception of leadership development programmes to nurture talent. 

* Offer periodic well-being initiatives or stress-relief activities, especially during peak workload phases. 


### 4) Global Pandemic: 
The years 2020-2022 were marked by the global COVID-19 pandemic. This unprecedented situation led to economic downturns, job uncertainties, and a re-evaluation of work-life priorities for many.  

In a post-pandemic world, it's important to realign organisational culture and values, ensuring they resonate with employee needs.  


 ## Summary

In an evolving professional landscape, it's imperative for organisations to be aware of turnover trends and remain adaptable and innovative in their approaches to retention. By doing this, businesses can ensure that they attract, and retain, the best talent and foster a dynamic and committed workforce.
